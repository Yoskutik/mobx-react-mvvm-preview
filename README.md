## Model

In this branch you can see all possibilities of the Model entity

In the first section there are 3 models: a base one, a model which overrides
some fields from base one and a model which extends a base one.

In the second sections there is a model with nested models. And in this
section you can see how to configure validation and watching process for such
nested models.

The third sections is pretty much the same as previous one, but in this
section the amount of nested models can be changed dynamically.
