# Mobx MVVM Preview

## DI

This branch is created to demonstrate the possibilities of the DI pattern in
ViewModel's.

In this sandbox there are some articles. You can mark some articles read, and
the system must notify you about it. Also, it should notify about some other
events like achieving 10 reads, and collect statistics.
